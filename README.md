<h1>Center for New Testament Restoration<br>Bunning Heuristic Prototype Greek New Testament</h1>

<h1>Description</h2>
The Bunning Heuristic Prototype (BHP) text was created by Alan Bunning in 2012 for the Center for New Testament Restoration as a preliminary template to approximate the results of the first computer-generated Greek New Testament. It is also believed to be the first critical text to ever include nomina sacra (represented by the ˚ symbol). Although the BHP was not originally intended to be released, it was made publicly available in 2017 at the request of unfoldingWord for use in their Bible translation software and has since been translated into several languages.
