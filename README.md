# Description
The 2012 Bunning Heuristic Prototype (BHP) text was created by Alan Bunning for the Center for New Testament Restoration as a preliminary template to approximate the results of the first computer-generated Greek New Testament. It is also believed to be the first critical text to ever include nomina sacra (represented by the ˚ symbol). Although the BHP was not originally intended to be released, it was made publicly available in 2017 at the request of unfoldingWord for use in their Bible translation software and has since been translated into several languages. [Further development work on the BHP has now ceased, as it has been deprecated with the release of the <a href=https://github.com/Center-for-New-Testament-Restoration/SR>Statistical Restoration (SR) Greek New Testament</a>.]
